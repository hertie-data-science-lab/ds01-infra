  container_hold_after_stop: 0.5h   # Auto-remove container after X hours stopped (null = never auto-remove)

  error_messages:
    mig_limit_exceeded: |
      ❌ GPU Limit Exceeded
      
      You requested {requested} MIG instances, but your limit is {max} MIGs.
      You currently have {current} MIGs allocated.
      
      Options:
      1. Reduce your MIG request to {available} or fewer
      2. Stop an existing container to free up GPUs
      3. Launch this container without GPU (CPU-only)
      
      Check your current allocations: ds01-gpu-status
      
    container_limit_exceeded: |
      ❌ Container Limit Exceeded
      
      You already have {current} containers running.
      Your limit is {max} containers.
      
      Please stop a container before creating a new one:
        mlc-stop <container-name>
      
    no_gpu_available: |
      ⚠️ No GPUs Available
      
      All GPUs are currently allocated to other users.
      
      Options:
      1. Wait for a GPU to become available
      2. Launch as CPU-only container for now
      3. Check GPU status: ds01-gpu-status
      
    reservation_conflict: |
      ❌ GPU Reserved
      
      The requested GPU is reserved for {reserved_user} until {end_time}.
      Reason: {reason}
      
      Please try a different GPU or wait for the reservation to end.
