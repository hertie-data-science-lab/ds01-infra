# ================================================
# DS01 Group Assignment Overrides
# ================================================
# This file overrides automatic group classification based on username patterns.
#
# PURPOSE: Deterministic group ASSIGNMENT (which group does user belong to?)
# NOT FOR: Resource limits (use config/user-overrides.yaml for custom limits)
#
# FORMAT: username:group
# - username: Exact match from /home/<username>
# - group: One of: student, researcher, faculty, admin
#
# PRIORITY ORDER:
# 1. archived.members (user skipped entirely)
# 2. THIS FILE (explicit override)
# 3. Pattern matching ([0-9]+@ = student, [a-z].[a-z]+@ = researcher)
#
# NOTE: This file is read by sync-group-membership.sh
# Changes take effect on next sync (daily at 4am or run manually)
# ================================================

# === PhD students with staff-style accounts ===
# These would auto-classify as "researcher" but some have numeric IDs
204214@hertie-school.lan:researcher     # Silke Kaiser - PhD

# === Faculty members ===
# Professors get elevated access (faculty group)
w.lowe@hertie-school.lan:faculty        # Will Lowe - Professor
l.kaack@hertie-school.lan:faculty       # Lena Kaack - Professor

# === System administrators ===
# IT staff with admin-level access
h.dang@hertie-school.lan:admin          # Huy Dang - IT
h.baker@hertie-school.lan:admin         # Henry Baker - Admin account

# === Researchers who should stay in researcher (explicit) ===
# Use this to prevent staff-style accounts from being mis-classified
c.fusarbassini@hertie-school.lan:researcher  # Chiara Fusarbassini - PhD
