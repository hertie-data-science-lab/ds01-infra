# DS01 Infrastructure - Deploy-Time Variables
# Sourced by deploy.sh for configuration generation
#
# This file contains environment-specific values that may vary between deployments.
# Currently minimal - paths are effectively constants for this deployment.

# ============================================================================
# Infrastructure Paths
# ============================================================================

# Root directory for DS01 infrastructure
INFRA_ROOT="/opt/ds01-infra"

# State directory for persistent data (grants, rate-limits, workload inventory)
STATE_DIR="/var/lib/ds01"

# Log directory
LOG_DIR="/var/log/ds01"

# ============================================================================
# System Groups
# ============================================================================

# Admin group with bypass privileges
DS01_ADMIN_GROUP="ds01-admin"

# Docker group for container access
DOCKER_GROUP="docker"

# ============================================================================
# Notes
# ============================================================================
# - These are currently constants but extracted for future multi-environment support
# - Add new variables here if they appear in 2+ config files
# - Don't extract immutable standards (e.g., systemd target names)
