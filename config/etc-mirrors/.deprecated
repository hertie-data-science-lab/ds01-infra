# This directory is DEPRECATED as of Phase 3.2-03

The etc-mirrors/ directory was used to store reference copies of files FROM /etc/.
This created confusion and duplication with config/deploy/.

## Migration (Phase 3.2-03)

- **profile.d/** → Consolidated into config/deploy/profile.d/
- **sudoers.d/** → Consolidated into config/deploy/sudoers.d/
- **systemd/**, **cron.d/**, **logrotate.d/** → Reviewed for overlaps, deploy/ is source of truth

## New Structure

- `config/deploy/` - Files to deploy TO /etc/ (source of truth)
- `config/runtime/` - Operational configs read during execution
- `config/state/` - Documents /var/lib/ds01 structure

## Remaining Files

Files in this directory after Phase 3.2-03 are retained for reference only but are NOT deployed.
For deploy sources, see config/deploy/.
