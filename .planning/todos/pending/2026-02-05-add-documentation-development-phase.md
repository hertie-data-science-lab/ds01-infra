title: Add systematic documentation development phase to roadmap
area: planning

## Problem

After the systematic audit/refactor/cleanup phase (3.2), the project needs a dedicated phase for systematically updating and developing user-facing and admin documentation. Current docs are ad-hoc and created during feature work — a focused phase would bring them to a consistent, comprehensive standard.

## Solution

Use `/gsd:add-phase` to add a documentation development phase to the roadmap. Scope should include:
- User-facing docs (docs-user/) for GitHub hosting
- Admin onboarding docs (docs-admin/)
- CLI command help text audit and standardisation
- Architecture documentation refresh
- README updates for open-source positioning

Should be scheduled after the current audit/cleanup phases are complete.
