"""dsl-alert-mail.py [--html] [--to A,B] [--cc C,D] [--thread KEY] <subject> [body] - mail through Graph.

The mail channel of `dsl-alert.sh`. Teams is a webhook this box may or may not have;
this is the channel that reaches a human who is not looking at the journal.

One transport, Microsoft Graph (application auth, certificate credential). There is
deliberately no SMTP fallback: the tenant disables SMTP AUTH, so a fallback could never
fire, and an alerter with a second untested send path is an alerter that fails silently.

Configured entirely from the environment, so the credential lives in one root-only file
(`/etc/dsl-alert-mail.env`, EnvironmentFile of `dsl-alert@.service`) and never in the repo:

    GRAPH_TENANT_ID        the Entra tenant
    GRAPH_CLIENT_ID        the lab's app registration
    GRAPH_SENDER           mailbox to send as, e.g. datasciencelab@hertie-school.org
    DSL_ALERT_TO           where the alert goes - one address or a comma-separated list
    DSL_ALERT_CC           optional, copied on every alert - same comma-separated form

and exactly one of, holding the certificate then its unencrypted private key:

    GRAPH_CLIENT_CERT_FILE a path, for a host that keeps the PEM in a root-only file
    GRAPH_CLIENT_CERT      the PEM itself, for GitHub Actions, where a secret is a value
                           and not a file. Same content as the toolkit's secret of that
                           name. Setting both is refused rather than silently preferring
                           one: two credentials in one environment is a rotation that went
                           half-finished, and picking a winner hides it.

Any of those still unset when the mailer runs is read out of `/etc/dsl-alert-mail.env`
itself (override with DSL_ALERT_ENV_FILE), because systemd is not the only caller: the
config watchdog and the monthly report run from cron, which inherits no EnvironmentFile.
The environment always wins over the file, and the file is parsed, never sourced - see
`load_env_file`.

`--to` REPLACES the environment for one call. `--cc` ADDS to it, and the asymmetry is the
point: DSL_ALERT_CC is the archive mailbox, which is copied on everything this lab sends,
and a caller that names a further recipient - a ticket notifier copying whoever opened the
ticket - must not be able to drop the archive by doing so. Nothing here can turn the
archive off; unsetting the variable is the only way, and that is a deployment decision.

An address on the Cc line that does not parse is DROPPED, with a masked line saying so; a
To address that does not parse is fatal. The difference is who typed it: the To line is
ours, and the Cc may carry whatever a public web form collected. Graph rejects the whole
message for one malformed recipient, so an un-vetted Cc would cost the alert itself.

The credential is a certificate, not a secret: the token request sends a thumbprint that
identifies the certificate and a signature made by the matching key, both derived from the
one PEM, so the two halves cannot drift apart. Entra never sees the private key.

Provisioning steps are in docs/admin/maintenance.md. Body on stdin, not argv: `/proc` on
this box is world-readable, so anything on a command line is visible in `ps`.

`--thread KEY` is OPT-IN THREADING, for a caller whose mails are episodes of one story -
the ticket notifier, where "filed", every comment and every escalation reminder belong in
one conversation in the reader's mailbox. KEY is an opaque stable string naming that story
(`ds01-hub-32`); every mail carrying the same KEY joins the same thread.

It changes the transport, which is why it is a flag and not the default. Graph's JSON
sendMail accepts `internetMessageHeaders` for custom `x-` headers only, so the headers a
mail client actually threads on cannot be set that way. Its MIME form can set anything:
same endpoint, `Content-Type: text/plain`, and a base64 RFC-5322 message as the body. See
`build_mime` for which headers and why. Two consequences worth knowing before you use it:

  1. The MIME form has no `saveToSentItems`, so a threaded mail IS kept in the sender
     mailbox's Sent Items where an alert is not. Harmless at ticket volume; it does mean a
     mailbox that is also on the Cc line keeps two copies.
  2. A threaded send that Graph refuses, or a subject MIME will not carry, FALLS BACK to
     the plain JSON send and says so. Threading is a courtesy; delivery is not. The one
     thing this mailer must never do is go quiet because the nice version broke.

Prints status codes and one-line outcomes only. Never a token, and never a response body -
a Graph error body echoes the request back, recipient included.

    `email.policy.SMTP` is what makes this safe to hand to Graph: CRLF endings, RFC-2047
    encoding for a subject carrying an umlaut, and a transfer encoding chosen per body -
    which matters because a body rendered from markdown routinely holds a single line
    longer than the 998 bytes a message is allowed. It also REFUSES a header value with a
    newline in it, which is the whole defence against a ticket title assembling headers of
    its own; the caller turns that refusal into a fallback rather than a traceback.

    `From` is the sending mailbox and cannot be anything else - Graph parses this into a
    draft in that mailbox and rejects a message claiming to be from someone else."""
