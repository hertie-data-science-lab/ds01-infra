## Get Started in <30 Minutes

```bash
# First time only
user-setup                    # Interactive setup wizard

# Create and launch a project
project init --guided         # Create project dir & setup 
project launch --guided       # Start working in containerised env

# ... work ...

exit                  
```

**That's it.** Your files in `/workspace` are always saved (persistent volumes).

New to containers? Add `--guided` to any command for step-by-step explanations.

> *See [quickstart](quickstart.md) for setup overview.*

## Background Knowledge

*Optional but useful to familiarise yourself with cloud-computing concepts*:

- [Servers & HPC](background/servers-and-hpc.md) - Shared computing environments
- [Containers & Docker](background/containers-and-docker.md) - Why containers exist
- [Ephemeral Philosophy](background/ephemeral-philosophy.md) - Why containers are temporary
- [Industry Parallels](background/industry-parallels.md) - How this maps to AWS/GCP/Kubernetes

> **Just want to deploy?** Skip background and go to [First Container](getting-started/first-container.md)

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Project workflow (recommended)
user-setup                    # First-time setup
project init                  # Create new project
project launch                # Start working

# Container workflow (more control)
container-deploy              # Create + start container
container-retire              # Stop + remove + free GPU

# Images
image-create                  # Build custom image

# Status
container-list                # Your containers
dashboard                     # System overview
check-limits                  # Your quotas
```

For all options: 
- `<command> --help` - for basic usage
- `<command> --info` - comprehensive usage documentaation
- `<command> --concepts` - pre-run explanation of key concepts involved
- `<command> --guided` - guided mode: detailed walkthough output at point-of-use
