## Project Setup

```bash
# Complete wizard
project-init my-project

# Individual steps
dir-create my-project                   # Create directory
git-init my-project                     # Initialize git
readme-create my-project                # Generate README

## System Status

```bash
ds01-dashboard                          # System overview
check-limits                            # Your quotas
```

---

## Inside Container

```bash
# Check GPU
nvidia-smi

# Python with GPU
python
>>> import torch
>>> torch.cuda.is_available()
True

# Files location
/workspace/                             # Your persistent files
```

---

## File Locations

```
Host                          Container
----                          ---------
~/workspace/my-project/   →   /workspace/
~/dockerfiles/            →   (build context)
```

## Getting Help

Every command supports 4 help modes:

```bash
<command> --help        # Quick reference (usage, main options)
<command> --info        # Full reference (all options, examples)
<command> --concepts    # Pre-run education (what is X?)
<command> --guided      # Interactive learning (explanations during)
```

**Examples:**
```bash
image-create --concepts   # Learn about images before creating one
container-deploy --info   # See all deploy options
container-stop --help     # Quick reminder of stop syntax
```

---

## Common Patterns

```bash
# Multiple experiments
container-deploy exp-1 --background
container-deploy exp-2 --background

# View logs
docker logs my-project._.$(whoami)

# Enter running container
container-run my-project

# Fix GPU issue
container-retire my-project
container-deploy my-project --gpu 1
```

---

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check status
container-list
ds01-dashboard

# View logs
docker logs my-project._.$(whoami)

# Recreate (fixes most issues)
container-retire my-project
container-deploy my-project
```
