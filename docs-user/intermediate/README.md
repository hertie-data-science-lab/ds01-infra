# Intermediate Guide

**For users who want more control over container lifecycle and CLI efficiency.**

---

## You're Ready If

- You're comfortable with `project launch` and `container deploy|retire`
- You want fine-grained control (create/start/stop/remove separately)
- You're interested in scripting and automation

## The Key Difference

**Beginner (Orchestrators):**
```bash
container deploy my-project   # Creates + starts
container retire my-project   # Stops + removes
```

**Intermediate (Atomic):**
```bash
container-create my-project   # Create only
container-start my-project    # Start only
container-stop my-project     # Stop only (keeps container)
container-remove my-project   # Remove only
```

**Why?** Debug issues step-by-step, pause without losing GPU, enable scripting.

## Suggested Path

1. [Command Hierarchy](command-hierarchy.md) - Understand L3/L2/L1 levels
2. [Atomic Commands](atomic-commands.md) - Learn the individual commands
3. [Container States](container-states.md) - Understand the full lifecycle
4. [CLI Flags](cli-flags.md) - Ditch interactive mode
5. [Scripting (Bash)](scripting-bash.md) or [Scripting (Python)](scripting-python.md) - Automate workflows
6. [Shell Aliases](shell-aliases.md) - Speed up common commands
