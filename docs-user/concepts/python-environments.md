# Python Environments in Containers

Understanding why DS01 containers replace traditional virtual environments.

---

## The Key Insight

**DS01 containers ARE your Python environment.**

Each container provides complete isolation - you don't need venv, conda, or virtualenv inside containers.

---

## Containers vs Virtual Environments

| Traditional Setup | DS01 Approach |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Create venv/conda env | Container provides isolation |
| `pip install` in venv | Packages installed at image build time |
| Activate environment | Just select the container's Python |
| Manage multiple Python versions | Each project has its own container/image |
| requirements.txt + manual setup | Dockerfile defines everything |

---

## What You DON'T Need

**Inside DS01 containers, you don't need to:**

- Create virtual environments (`python -m venv`)
- Use conda environments (`conda create`)
- Worry about environment activation
- Manage multiple Python versions
- Deal with PATH issues

**The container handles all of this.**

---

## Installing Packages

### At Image Build Time (Recommended)

Add packages to your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# In ~/workspace/<project-name>/Dockerfile
RUN pip install transformers datasets torch
```

Then rebuild your image:

```bash
image-update <project-name>
container-retire <project-name>
container-deploy <project-name>
```

**Benefits:**
- Packages persist across container restarts
- Reproducible environment
- Fast container startup

### At Runtime (Temporary)

For quick experiments:

```bash
# Inside container
pip install package-name
```

Or in Jupyter notebooks:

```python
# Use %pip (Jupyter magic), not !pip
%pip install package-name
```

> **Why `%pip`?** The `%pip` magic ensures the running kernel can find newly installed packages. Using `!pip` may require a kernel restart.

**Note:** Runtime installs are lost when container is removed. Add frequently-used packages to your Dockerfile.

---

## Selecting Python in VS Code

When working with notebooks in VS Code:

1. Click "Select Kernel" or the kernel indicator
2. Choose "Python Environments"
3. Select `/usr/bin/python`

> **Note:** You may see both `/usr/bin/python` and `/bin/python` listed - they're identical (symlinks). Either works.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" after pip install

**In Jupyter:**
- If you used `!pip install`, restart the kernel
- Better: use `%pip install` next time

**In terminal:**
- Verify you're inside the container, not on the host
- Check with `which python` - should be `/usr/bin/python`

### Package installed but not importable

**Check you're in the right environment:**
```bash
# Inside container
which python    # Should be /usr/bin/python
pip list | grep <package-name>
```

### Kernel won't connect (VS Code)

- Reload VS Code window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
- Check Jupyter output: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Jupyter: Show Output"

---

## Why This Approach?

### Industry Standard

This is how production ML works:

- **Docker**: Standard for ML deployment
- **Kubernetes**: Containers are the unit of deployment
- **Cloud ML**: SageMaker, Vertex AI, etc. use containers

### Reproducibility

```dockerfile
# This Dockerfile IS your environment
FROM pytorch/pytorch:2.0.1-cuda11.7-cudnn8-runtime
RUN pip install transformers==4.30.0 datasets==2.13.0
```

Share the Dockerfile, anyone can recreate your exact environment.

### Isolation

Each project gets its own container:
- No package conflicts between projects
- No "it works on my machine" problems
- Clean separation of concerns

---

## Common Patterns

### Per-Project Environments

```
~/workspace/
├── thesis/
│   ├── Dockerfile          # PyTorch + transformers
│   └── ...
├── course-ml/
│   ├── Dockerfile          # sklearn + pandas
│   └── ...
└── experiment/
    ├── Dockerfile          # JAX + optax
    └── ...
```

Each project has its own Dockerfile = its own environment.

### Sharing Environments

**Same base, different projects:**
```dockerfile
# Both projects can use same base
FROM aime/pytorch:24.09
```

**Exact reproduction:**
```bash
# Share your Dockerfile
cp ~/workspace/project/Dockerfile ~/shared/
```
