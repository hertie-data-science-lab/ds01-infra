## Suggested Learning Paths

### Path 1: Beginner (Students, First-Time Users)
**"I just want to work on my thesis"**

1. [First-Time Setup](getting-started/first-time.md) - 15 minutes
2. [Daily Workflow](getting-started/daily-workflow.md) - Core routine
3. [Jupyter Setup](guides/jupyter.md) - If using notebooks
4. [VS Code Remote](guides/vscode-remote.md) - If using VS Code

**Use:** 
- Project-oriented: `project launch`, `exit`
- Container-oriented: `image create`,`container deploy`, `container retire`

**Skip the background reading** - learn as you go with `--guided` mode.

### Path 2: Intermediate (IDE-based)
**"I want more control and efficiency"**

1. [Atomic Commands](intermediate/atomic-commands.md) - Granular control
2. [CLI Flags](intermediate/cli-flags.md) - Faster than interactive mode
3. [Scripting](intermediate/scripting.md) - Automate workflows

**Use:** `container-create`, `container-start`, `container-stop`, `container-remove`

### Path 3: Advanced (Terminal & DevOps Native)
**"I prefer Docker commands and terminal workflows"**

1. [Docker Direct](advanced/docker-direct.md) - Standard Docker commands
2. [Terminal Workflows](advanced/terminal-workflows.md) - vim/tmux development
3. [Batch Jobs](advanced/batch-jobs.md) - Non-interactive execution

**Use:** `docker run`, `docker exec`, direct container access

### Bonus Path(!): Understanding First
**"I want to know how this works"**

1. [What are containers?](concepts/containers-and-images.md)
2. [Why are containers temporary?](concepts/ephemeral-containers.md)
3. [Where are my files?](concepts/workspaces-persistence.md)
4. [Cloud skills you're learning](concepts/ephemeral-containers.md#industry-parallels)

Then proceed to practical guides.

## Practical Guides

Step-by-step instructions for common tasks:

- [Daily Workflow](guides/daily-workflow.md) - This is the core workflow
- [Custom Images](guides/custom-images.md) - Install your own packages
- [GPU Usage](guides/gpu-usage.md) - Request, monitor, release GPUs
- [Long-Running Jobs](guides/long-running-jobs.md) - Overnight training
- [Jupyter Setup](guides/jupyter.md) - Jupyter Lab with SSH tunnels
- [VSCode Remote](guides/vscode-remote.md) - Remote development

## Background Knowledge

*Optional but useful to familiarise yourself with cloud-computing concepts*:

- [Servers & HPC](background/servers-and-hpc.md) - Shared computing environments
- [Containers & Docker](background/containers-and-docker.md) - Why containers exist
- [Ephemeral Philosophy](background/ephemeral-philosophy.md) - Why containers are temporary
- [Industry Parallels](background/industry-parallels.md) - How this maps to AWS/GCP/Kubernetes

> **Just want to deploy?** Skip background and go to [First Container](getting-started/first-container.md)
