## What This Section Is

These docs provide broader computing education that goes beyond DS01. They explain the technology, industry practices, and transferable skills you're developing.

**Read these when:**
- You want to understand *why* things work the way they do
- You're preparing for industry roles (ML engineer, data scientist, DevOps)
- You want to connect DS01 to AWS, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms
- You're curious about the underlying technology

**Time investment:** ~1 hour total (read based on interest)

## Contents

### Computing Fundamentals

These topics build foundational knowledge that transfers to any computing environment.

#### [Servers & High-Performance Computing](servers-and-hpc.md) — 10 min
>What servers are, how shared computing works, HPC concepts, resource scheduling.

#### [Linux Command Line](linux-basics.md) — 15 min
>Essential commands, file system navigation, permissions, shell scripting basics.

### Container Technology

Understanding Docker deeply helps you work with any container platform.

#### [Containers & Docker](containers-and-docker.md) — 12 min
>What containers are, how Docker works, images vs containers, layers, isolation. Relevant for Kubernetes, Docker Compose, CI/CD pipelines, and microservices architecture.

#### [Workspaces & Persistence](workspaces-and-persistence.md) — 5 min
>Stateless vs stateful, volume mounts, persistent storage patterns.

### DS01 Design Philosophy

Understand *why* DS01 works this way and how it prepares you for industry.

#### [Ephemeral Container Philosophy](ephemeral-philosophy.md) — 5 min
>Why containers are temporary, benefits of stateless design, resource efficiency.

#### [Resource Management](resource-management.md) — 5 min
>Fair sharing, quotas, cgroups, scheduling.

### Industry Context

See how DS01 maps to production systems.

#### [Industry Parallels](industry-parallels.md) — 10 min
>How DS01 compares to AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, HPC systems.

## How These Differ from the `Concepts` section

| Background (This Section) | Concepts Section |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| General computing education | DS01-specific |
| "Why things work this way" | "What you need to know" |
| Transferable career skills | Practical usage |
| ~1 hour total | 20 min total |
| Optional but valuable | Recommended |
